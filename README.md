## Reprogramming

A list of reprogramming datasets was compiled, four of which were selected for further analysis. For each dataset, raw count matrices were obtained if not publicly accessible, metadata were assembled, a variance‐stabilizing transformation (VST) was applied, and Spearman’s correlation coefficients were computed for each gene and hallmark. The code implementing these transformations is provided in the Trajectories/Reprogramming folder.
